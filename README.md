The visual novel is directed towards the aforementioned age group as it is mostly teenagers and young adults of this time who are suffering from mental illnesses, prominently depression, due to factors such as the personal comparisons made between other individuals with the exposure of social media, bullying or academic stress.

### Creation

The application will be programmed with Ren’Py, a software that aids the creation of visual novels. Ren’Py is new-user friendly but also allows for more difficult programming if necessary. The final product is meant to be played on PC. The most notable game created with Ren’Py is Dan Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club.

### Design Goals

The game aims to make the audience feel emotionally touched and intrigued in general. On a smaller scale, it should raise a multitude of emotions including anxiety, hope or comfort depending on the scene being portrayed and the ending that the player gets. At the end, it comes down to all aspects of the visual novel, including the story, music and art.

### Story

The story should be well-written, utilizing meaningful or eloquent language to impact the reader. Literary techniques should be implemented such as foreshadowing or metaphors that can enhance the complexity or meaning of the story. Examples include simple and short sentences for impact in a scene involving suicide or eloquent comparisons and imagery for a touching scene.

### Music

The music should be composed differently for different sections. Using music theory can help to understand what makes different music tense or pleasant. Different layering of music can also create different effects. Examples include a slow, consonant, piano piece for a calming scene or a grand orchestra with dissonance in a scene which is a negative climax.

### Art

Aspects of the anime art style can be manipulated to imply different ideas. This idea holds true for the setting and the design of the background as well. Horror or anxiety can be created with darker tones or drawing aspects that seem not to be confined to norms (ex. No highlight in eyes = mentally or physically dead). Pleasant emotions can be triggered with the use of warm color and objects with positive connotations in a scene.

## Key Scenes or Backgrounds

### Background: Classroom

A classroom will make common appearances in the story as it is a suitable place in which development can occur between characters. The player can explore the dynamic of different characters within a classroom scene and can also be introduced or interact with the main characters in the game.

### Background: School gates or main plaza (can be discussed)

The school gates or main plaza of the school can be used for development and encounters between characters. It serves the same purpose as the classroom but can convey different ideas due to the aspect of exiting and entering the school.

### Background: Bedrooms/homes of main characters

The bedrooms or homes of each character, including the protagonist, can be used to deduce many traits of each character as the homes or bedrooms often reflect the owner of the room. Objects can be hidden and described in the dialogue to foreshadow events or represent ideas. Overall, a setting with a lot of potential.

### Key Scene: Suicide/disappearance Scene (explicit or implied)

This scene will serve as the bad ending of a route, although how it is executed will vary person to person. The degree of intensity the scene will portray will be further discussed. Regardless, a key CG will be used to suggest the death of the main character when the player makes the “wrong” choices.

### Key Scene: Neutral/lifeless Scene

This scene serves as the neutral ending of a route. The main character does not die. However, it will indicate to the reader that the mental issue is not fully solved and the character is only partially saved. Although the character has not died, she may be implied to live a moderate or terrible life. A key CG will be used to indicate to the reader that the route is achieved.

### Key Scene: Saved Scene

This scene is the good ending to the route. The main character is alive and saved from her mental issue. The scene is meant to trigger a positive emotion (ex. Touching, happy, uplifting) in the player. Key CGs could portray the character with a beaming smile or even hint at love with the protagonist depending from character to character.
