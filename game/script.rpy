    # PANEL ONE: From pitch black, the view of ascending stairs fades in.
    scene bg meadow

    "The silence in the dark."
    "The stone-cold steps."
    "The steady monotonous rhythm."
    "The familiar environment as I tread up the steps towards my familiar garden of eden."


    # PANEL TWO: The light of the street lamps, bright but bleak, illuminates each step as the PLAYER ascends. The moon hangs high in the starry night sky.
    scene bg meadow
    # (SFX: Steady footsteps climbing stairs; faint rustle of leaves)


    # PANEL THREE: Under the deep night sky, the end of the stairs approaches. Fade to white.
    scene bg meadow
    # (SFX: loud rustle of trees, as if a strong gust of wind blew past)
    "As I reached the top of the unkempt and antiquated stone stairs among the waltz of the tranquil night breeze, the obscuring view of the inclined slope, seemingly like a mirage, evanesces from my sight to reveal a heavenly enclosure."


    # PANEL FOUR: A breathtaking sight fades in. The serene enclosure, concealed by lush trees, has a clear path leading towards its center – an elegant pavilion with a standing figure.
    scene bg meadow
    "Everything was as I had remembered it to be."
    "The sea of vibrant chrysanthemums, the blanket of the opalescent silver moonlight and the comfortable pavilion that lies in solitary at the center of the enclosure."
    "Yet, in the familiar scene, lies an unfamiliar figure, drawing me closer as I tread on the clear path leading towards the center, among the tranquil dance of the chrysanthemums."
    # (SFX: footsteps as the player approaches the pavilion)


    # PANEL FIVE: The pavilion gets closer and closer, and the standing figure slowly becomes recognizable. A slender, feminine silhouette standing still in the silver moonlight, under the tranquil dance of the chrysanthemums that envelope the enclosure.
    scene bg meadow
    # (SFX: steady footsteps; faint heartbeats)


    # PANEL SIX: With her back facing the player, the figure does not turn to check the approaching footsteps. Fade to white.
    scene bg meadow


    # PANEL SEVEN: Fade in. There she sat. KUROKI HANA, a beautiful girl in a pale, white dress. A glittering drip of tear trickles down her moonlit, ethereal visage.
    scene bg meadow
    "And there she sat. Her ephemeral beauty blossomed under the moonlit opalescent night, accompanied by the swirls of chrysanthemum petals that glisten under the illumination of the stars."
    "Her hair of silk, the color of cherry blossoms, flows down her back as she looks up into the starry night."
    "As the petals swirled, seemingly enclosing and isolating us from the realm of reality, I moved forward along the path only to stop a moderate distance away from the bench she sat, close like the chrysanthemums of the path yet distant like the stars of the sky."


    # PANEL EIGHT: Surprised but not startled, she takes off her earphones and wipes the sparkling teardrop on her cheek. She gives a polite smile and walks away.
    scene bg meadow
    "Breaking from a trance, she turned around."
    "Sapphire tears flowed from her eyes, contrasting her bright, elegant visage."
    hs "..."
    "The mysterious girl smiles and walks away."
    # (SFX: clicks of heels)


    # PANEL NINE: Hana walks to the stairs without turning back. Fade to black.
    scene bg meadow
    "That was our first meeting."
    "And a meeting that I will never forget."







    # "After a short while, we reach the meadows just outside the neighborhood where we both live."

    # "It's a scenic view I've grown used to. Autumn is especially beautiful here."

    # "When we were children, we played in these meadows a lot, so they're full of memories."

    # m "Hey... Umm..."

    # show sylvie green smile

    # "She turns to me and smiles. She looks so welcoming that I feel my nervousness melt away."

    # "I'll ask her...!"

    # m "Ummm... Will you..."

    # m "Will you be my artist for a visual novel?"

    # show sylvie green surprised

    # "Silence."
